### Hi there, Clemens (he/him) here! ðŸ‘‹

Right now I am a masters student in the Developmental, Neural and Behavioral Biology programm at the University of GÃ¶ttingen. In my studies I focus on cellular, developmental and systems biology. Additionally I work as a bioinformatics pipeline developer at the Johann-Friedrich-Blumenbach-Institute for Zoology and Anthropology in the group Animal Evolution and Biodiversity. You can find projects mainly concerning my work and leisurely programming on here!
